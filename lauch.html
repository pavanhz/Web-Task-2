                    <p> I have been wanting to buy an electric car for a long time. A few months ago I bought a BMW i7. The interior
                         of this car is so Impressive and tech based that it feels like you are stepping into the future. The driving
                          experience with this car is quiet and the acceleration is exhilarating. Finding convenient charging stations 
                          for me on long trips sometimes becomes a puzzle. The i7 comes across as the symbol of electric luxury which 
                          beautifully combines performance or comfort and eco friendliness. It truly feels like driving the future.
                    </p>

                <div class="testimonial-col">

                        <img src="./Images/profile-icon.webp" alt="">
                        <div class="user-info">
                            <h4>Piyush Ramavath</h4>
                            <small>@P_ramavath</small>

                    <p>
                        The i7 model's potential to provide long-lasting opulence and be an electrical goddess excites me. One of my
                         favourite electric cars, this one has such great features that manage to be both timeless and technologically 
                         advanced. Strange as it may seem, the i7 exemplifies BMW's mission to manufacture electric buses that set new 
                         standards for road-savvyness. This poster is sure to be remembered for its slice-byte technology, user-friendly
                          design, and eco-friendly driving experience that is both practical and cosy. My favourite part about this 
                          concept is the flexibility it provides to anyone in possession of a stunning water feature—one that marries
                           the goddess of electricity with everlasting riches.

                        With its revolutionary Design and powerful technology, the BMW i7 redefines electric luxury as you punch
                         into the now of luxury motorcars. With its electric machine, ample cabin, and Modern features, the i7 provides 
                         a sustainable andeco-friendly option for coincidental Safety. When on lengthy road peregrinations and driving 
                         through metropolitan Highways, the i7 offers an instigative and effective ride that's also environmentally
                          sustainable. Every point of the BMW i7, from its Modern infotainment system to its futuristic appearance,
                           is intended to ameliorate my driving experience and reshape the geography of electric luxury.
